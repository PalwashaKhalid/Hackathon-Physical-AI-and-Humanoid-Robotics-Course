# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**. This book will guide you through the fascinating world of embodied intelligence, teaching you how to build, simulate, and control humanoid robots using modern tools and frameworks.

## About This Book

This book covers four core pillars of Physical AI development:

1. **ROS 2** - The backbone of robot communication and control
2. **Simulation Environments** - Gazebo and Unity for testing and development
3. **NVIDIA Isaac Platform** - Advanced robotics development with Isaac Sim
4. **Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Systems** - Making robots understand and respond to the world

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this book, you will be able to:

- Understand the fundamentals of Physical AI and embodied intelligence
- Set up and configure ROS 2 for humanoid robot control
- Create and simulate humanoid robots in Gazebo and Unity
- Integrate NVIDIA Isaac platform for advanced robotics development
- Build a complete "Voice-to-Action" humanoid robot pipeline
